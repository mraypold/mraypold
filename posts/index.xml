      <description>The Laravel queue and event system is one of the most powerful features of the framework and indispensable if you want to build a modern web application.
The queue provides a performant means to run background tasks that don’t block your HTTP lifecycle, allowing you to serve up a responsive application to your customers. Typically, you would use the queue to send emails, collect metrics or generate reports, amongst a number of other tasks that are either time consuming, prone to failure or can be done in an asynchronous manner that don’t impede the user’s workflow.</description>

      <description>The Laravel maintainers have begun to invest more time in providing features and tooling for managing Laravel in a distributed environment.
Laravel 5.4 modified the withoutOverlapping() option for kernel tasks (PR #16196) to use the cache to create a lock and prevent overlapping scheduled tasks across instances.
Laravel Horizon makes it easier to monitor and maintain Laravel powered Redis queues in both a distributed and single instance deployment.
Laravel 5.5 includes TrustedProxy so that you can more easily place your application behind a load balancer.</description>
